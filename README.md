**Steps:**

1. **Create a repository github.io on GitHub. This repository will host the GitHub Pages site.**

2. **Clone the repository to the local computer. This lets us create and edit files locally.**

3. **Create an index.html file in the root of the repository. GitHub Pages always loads this file first.**

4. **Commit and push the files to the main branch.GitHub Pages only shows what is pushed to GitHub.**

5. **Open https://USERNAME.github.io/ to view the site. This is where your page appears after pushing.**



**Takeaways:** 

**The exercise was fun and enjoyable as I am able to finish a complete portfolio layout using only HTML and CSS. Properly grouping content and assigning clear section IDs makes navigation simple and effective without using JavaScript. Clean spacing, consistent layout patterns, and readable typography are enough to create a visually organized and functional site.**
